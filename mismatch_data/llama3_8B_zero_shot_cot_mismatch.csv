 The premise states that Nicole is more attractive than Pamela. This means that Nicole has some quality (attractiveness) that is greater than Pamela's.

The hypothesis states that Nicole and Pamela can be compared in terms of how attractive they are. This means that the premise is providing a basis for comparison between the two individuals.

Since the premise is providing a basis for comparison, it supports the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment (B).",41,"B","comparative-1","2024-05-28T13:06:45.099585Z"
