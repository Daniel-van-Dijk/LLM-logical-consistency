entailment    Jeff has political science class then biology class then physics class.    Physics class is the last class among the three.    Given the premise, is the hypothesis true?    To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we need to consider the order of Jeff's classes. The premise states that Jeff's classes are in the order: political science, biology, physics. Given this order, it is clear that physics class is indeed the last class among the three.    Therefore, the hypothesis is true based on the premise.
contradiction     Johnny is to the right of Pamela. Pamela is to the right of Andrew.    Johnny is to the left of Andrew.    Is the hypothesis supported by the premise?    According to the premise, Pamela is to the right of Andrew, and Johnny is to the right of Pamela. Now, let's look at the hypothesis. If Johnny is to the right of Pamela and Pamela is to the right of Andrew, then it follows logically that Johnny must also be to the right of Andrew, not to the left.    So, based on the premise, the hypothesis is not supported.
neutral    Some of the headphones are green in color.    None of the headphones are magenta in color.    Given the premise, is the hypothesis (a) entailment, (b) neutral, or (c) contradiction?    To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's consider the possibilities: If some of the headphones are green, it doesn't necessarily mean that none of them are magenta. The premise only states that some are green; it doesn't exclude the possibility of some being magenta. However, if the premise had stated "All of the headphones are green," then the hypothesis "None of the headphones are magenta" would be an entailment because if all headphones are green, then none are magenta. The premise does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis.    (b) neutral
entailment    Premise: Does Walter give the money? No.    Hypothesis: Walter does not give the money.    Does the hypothesis logically follow from the premise?    The premise is a negative statement indicating that Walter does not give the money. The hypothesis is essentially restating the premise in a different form. Given that the premise explicitly states that Walter does not give the money, the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise and therefore follows logically from it.    Therefore, yes, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
contradition    Ben is the child of Amy. Donald is the child of Amy.    Hypothesis: Amy has only 1 children.    Does the hypothesis entail or contradict from the premise? The premise explicitly states that Ben and Donald are both children of Amy. Therefore, Amy has at least two children according to the premise. The hypothesis, however, suggests that Amy has only one child, which contradicts the premise. If Amy has two children (Ben and Donald), then the hypothesis is contradicted by the premise.    Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.
neutral    Anthony is irritable.    Anthony is an architect.    Given the premise, is the hypothesis true?    There doesn't appear to be a direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Being irritable doesn't inherently imply anything about Anthony's profession. Therefore, based solely on the premise that Anthony is irritable, we cannot determine the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis that Anthony is an architect.    Therefore, the truth of the hypothesis cannot be determined from the given premise.
entailment    Even Sandra failed the exam.    Sandra was among the least likely to fail the exam.    Is the hypothesis supported by the premise?    If we consider the premise, "Even Sandra failed the exam," it implies that Sandra's failure was unexpected or unusual. The use of "even" suggests that Sandra's failure was surprising, possibly because she was perceived as unlikely to fail. In this context, if Sandra, who was perceived as unlikely to fail, actually failed, it implies that others who were perceived as more likely to fail may have also failed. This reasoning suggests that Sandra's failure contradicted the expectations or perceptions of her likelihood of failing. Therefore, the hypothesis, "Sandra was among the least likely to fail the exam," logically follows from the premise because Sandra's unexpected failure implies that she was perceived as less likely to fail compared to others who may have failed.    Thus, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
contradiction    All of the brushes are purple in colour.    Some of the brushes are purple in colour.    Does the hypothesis entail or contradict from the premise?    The premise states that all brushes are purple, meaning every single brush is purple. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that only some of the brushes are purple, which implies that not all brushes are purple. Given that the premise explicitly states that all brushes are purple, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. If all brushes are purple, then it cannot be true that only some of them are purple.    Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.
neutral    If Bruce comes to the hotel, Matt won't come. Bruce did not come to the hotel.    Matt didn't come to the hotel.    Given the premise, is the hypothesis (a) entailment, (b) neutral, or (c) contradiction?    Given the premise, we know that Bruce did not come to the hotel. However, the premise does not provide any direct information about Matt's attendance. The premise only establishes a conditional relationship: if Bruce comes to the hotel, Matt won't come. But since Bruce didn't come, we can't conclude anything about Matt's presence or absence based solely on the premise.    (b) neutral
