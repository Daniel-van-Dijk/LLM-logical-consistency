Explanation:
A neutral statement would be one that doesn't contradict or support the premise. For example, ""Some of the pens are made of plastic"" is a neutral statement because it doesn't contradict the premise ""None of the pens are pink in colour.""

An entailing statement is one that logically follows from the premise. For example, ""None of the pens are blue"" is an entailing statement because if none of the pens are pink, then none of them can be pink or blue.
