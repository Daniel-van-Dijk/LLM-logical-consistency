A neutral statement would be one that doesn't contradict or support the premise. For example, ""Some of the pens are made of plastic"" is a neutral statement because it doesn't contradict the premise ""None of the pens are pink in colour.""

 Answer: 

Based on the information given in the premise and hypothesis, the relationship between them is:

C. entailment

Explanation:
