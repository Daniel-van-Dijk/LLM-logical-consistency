The hypothesis states that Alison and Evelyn can be compared in terms of how scary they are. This means that the hypothesis assumes that there is some common ground or basis for comparison between the two individuals.

Given the premise ""Alison is scarier than Evelyn,"" it does not contradict the hypothesis, as the hypothesis allows for the possibility that one person may be scarier than the other. In fact, the premise could be seen as providing an example or specific instance of the comparison that the hypothesis allows for.

Therefore, the answer is A. neutral. The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it also does not necessarily follow from it directly.

The hypothesis states that ""Dick and Brian can be compared in terms of how nice they are."" This means that the hypothesis assumes that Dick and Brian can be compared based on a certain trait (niceness).

Given the premise ""Dick is nicer than Brian,"" it implies that there is a difference in niceness between the two individuals. However, it does not necessarily mean that they cannot be compared based on this trait. In fact, the premise assumes that they can be compared since it makes a direct statement about their niceness levels.

Therefore, the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise. The premise implies that the hypothesis is true.

1. Greg was facing West.
2. He turned to his back.

Now, let's consider the hypothesis: ""Greg is now facing East.""

To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to figure out if the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, contradicts the premise, or is neutral.

1. Entailment: If the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, then it is an entailment. In other words, if the premise implies the hypothesis, then the relationship is entailment.
2. Contradiction: If the hypothesis directly opposes the premise, then the relationship is contradiction.
3. Neutral: If the hypothesis neither follows logically from the premise nor contradicts it, then the relationship is neutral.

Let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis:

1. Greg was facing West.

The hypothesis ""Greg is now facing East"" is not an entailment because the premise ""Greg was facing West and turned to his back"" does not directly imply that Greg is now facing East.

The premise states that San Jose is located between Rochester and Kansas. This means that Rochester is to the north of San Jose, and Kansas is to the south of San Jose.

The hypothesis states that Rochester is nearer to Kansas than Rochester is to San Jose. However, since the premise states that San Jose is located between Rochester and Kansas, it follows that the distance from Rochester to San Jose is greater than the distance from San Jose to Kansas.

Therefore, the hypothesis is a contradiction to the premise.

The premise states that Madison is located between Phoenix and Dallas. This means that Dallas is to the east of Madison, and Phoenix is to the west of Madison. The hypothesis states that Phoenix is nearer to Dallas than Phoenix is to Madison.

To evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, we need to determine which statement is closer to being true:

1. Madison is located between Phoenix and Dallas.
2. Phoenix is nearer to Dallas than Phoenix is to Madison.

Based on the given information, statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false. Therefore, the hypothesis is a contradiction to the premise.

The hypothesis ""Suzanne has at least 4 rubbers"" is not a direct contradiction to the premise ""Suzanne has 6 rubbers,"" because the hypothesis is not stating that Suzanne has fewer than 6 rubbers. Instead, it is stating that she has at least 4. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a contradiction.

Since the hypothesis is not a contradiction, it is neither a direct contradiction nor a tautology, so it must be neutral. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis is actually an entailment of the premise, because having at least 4 rubbers implies having 6 or more. But since the hypothesis does not explicitly state that Suzanne has exactly 6 rubbers, it is not a logical entailment in the strictest sense.
